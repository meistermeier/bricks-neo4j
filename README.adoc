= Bricks-Neo4j

_A brick database in Neo4j._

Besides having a whole catalog of a well-known brick company, the idea is to ask the database what one could build with a given set.

A documentation of the process and some ideas can be found at https://blog.meier.cloud/bricks4j/

IMPORTANT: There will be updates to the underlying data, so please check from time to time if the _import.cypher_ has changed.

TIP: There is now a Dockerfile that prepares everything for you.
