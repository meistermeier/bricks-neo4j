For an easy start to play with the data, I recommend to use the Docker image from the https://github.com/meistermeier/bricks4j/tree/main/docker[docker folder of the repository].

The first two steps are rather simple:
[source,shell]
.Build the image
----
docker build -t <meistermeier/brick4j:latest | or a better name> . 
----

This creates you an image with some defaults like user/pw: neo4j/secret, the data to import and some import scripts.

[source,shell]
.Run the image
----
docker run -p7474:7474 -p7687:7687 <meistermeier/brick4j:latest | or a better name>
----

Start a container with the exposed browser(7474) and bolt(7687) ports to interact with the instance from your host machine.

In the last step you call the _import.cypher_ script.

[source,shell]
.Run the import
----
docker exec -it <your container id> /var/lib/neo4j/import/import.sh
----

After this you could start to play with the data.
