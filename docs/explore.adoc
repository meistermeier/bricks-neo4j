=== Verify description and parts defined by relationships

Compare number of parts to the set description.

[source,cypher]
----
MATCH (s:Set)-[:DEFINED_BY]->(:Inventory)-[:NEEDS]->(pg:PartGroup)<-[r:IS_PART_OF]-(:Part)
WHERE s.name =~ ".* Dodge Charger" AND NOT pg.isSpare 
RETURN s.name, s.numberOfParts, sum(r.quantity);
----

result

|===
| s.name | s.numberOfParts | sum(r.quantity)

| "Domâ€™s Dodge Charger" | 1077 | 1077
|===

=== Spare parts of a set

Quantity and part number of spare parts.

[source,cypher]
----
MATCH (s:Set)-[:DEFINED_BY]->()-[:NEEDS]->(pg:PartGroup{isSpare:true})<-[pr:IS_PART_OF]-(:Part)
WHERE s.number = "42088-1" 
RETURN pr.quantity, pg.partNumber;
----

result

|===
| pr.quantity | pg.partNumber

| 1 | "4274"
| 1 | "32123b"
| 1 | "6141"
| 1 | "6141"
| 1 | "54200"
| 1 | "6141"
| 1 | "58176"
| 1 | "2780"

=== Parts to elements

It is important to understand that a `Part` defined in the `PartGroup` is not matching a specific "part number" in the manual.
Those are more generic numbers that may be defined in various versions (like an _a_ or _b_ suffix).
To match the real number given in the manual, we are using also the `Element` types.
Those are mapping part numbers (logical number) to element ids (the physical thing, let's call them bricks).
Since the physical parts are colored there are at least one element id for every color the part is available in.

For a _Technic Bush 1/2 Smooth with Axle Hole Semi-Reduced_ (32123b) this would be:
[source,cypher]
----
MATCH (e:Element)-[:HAS_COLOR]->(c:Color)
WHERE e.partNumber = "32123b"
RETURN e.partNumber, e.elementId, c.name;
----

result

|===
| e.partNumber | e.elementId | c.name

| "32123b" | "4110050" | "Light Gray"
| "32123b" | "4211573" | "Light Bluish Gray"
| "32123b" | "6271167" | "Yellow"
| "32123b" | "3212324" | "Yellow"
| "32123b" | "6271165" | "Light Bluish Gray"
|===

This basically means that the bricks are interchangeable.
Of course even better if there are two bricks for the same part number sharing the same color.
