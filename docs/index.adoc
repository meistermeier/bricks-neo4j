* Complete the import and information gathering around the missing elements.
* Create an application around the data.
Just read-only first.
* Create custom inventory that contains parts to match against existing sets.
** This will enable the functionality to determine how many sets can be built with your home inventory.
* Try to calculate the missing parts between the custom inventory and the chosen set.
* Define fallback part definitions that would enable building a model 100% even if not 100% of the defined parts in a set exist in the custom inventory.
** Ignore colors
** Physical replacement: e.g. 2x2 could be a replacement for a 1x4 brick
